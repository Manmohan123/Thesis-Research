\begin{abstract}
  Scheduling theory is a common tool to analyze the
  performance of parallel and distributed computing systems, such as their load
  balance. How to distribute the input data to be able to execute a
  set of tasks in a minimum amount of time can be modeled as a
  scheduling problem. Often these models assume that the computation
  time required for each task is known accurately. However in many
  practical case, only approximate values are available at the time of
  scheduling.

  In this paper, we investigate how replicating the data required by
  the tasks can help coping with the inaccuracies of the processing
  times. In particular, we investigate the problem of scheduling
  independent tasks to optimize the makespan on a parallel system
  where the processing times of tasks are only known up to a
  multiplicative factor. The problem is decomposed in two phases: a
  first offline phase where the data of the tasks are placed and a second
  online phase where the tasks are actually scheduled.

  For this problem we investigate three different strategies, each
  allowing a different degree of replication of jobs: a) No
  Replication b) Replication everywhere and c) Replication in
  groups. We propose approximation algorithms and theoretical lower
  bound on achievable approximation ratios.  This allows us to study
  the tradeoff between the number of replication and the guarantee on
  the makespan.

\section{Introduction}

Parallel and distributed computing systems are often modeled using
tasks that are processed simultaneously on different
machines. Studying the balance of the load of the various component of
the system is often key in understanding the performance one obtains
in practice. A system typically schedules the set of tasks with the
goal of optimizing the load balance (or makespan) of the system or
some other metric. A key information these system use to plan the
execution is the time tasks will take to be processed. However, this
information is typically not precisely known in practice: because the
user can only make a wild guess on the runtime of her
task~\cite{Luong2008}, because prediction is hard in the general
case~\cite{Wilhelm2008}, or because underlying models of a particular
algorithm can only predict runtime within a given
range~\cite{Erlebacher14-ICS}. Whichever the reason is, not knowing
accurately the processing time can significantly impact the
performance obtained from the machine.

Though, the uncertainty in processing time is only a real problem if
the task is pinned to a particular computing unit. If the task could
be moved as the system sees fit without incurring an extra cost, the
problem would be vastly alleviated. The problem is that in practice,
the task has to run on a particular machine because the input data for
this task are only available on this machine. This is the case in most
parallel and distributed systems and it is particularly true in
out-of-core computing systems. For instance in out-of-core sparse
linear algebra, executing a task where the data are not locally
available would have a prohibitive
overhead~\cite{Zhou12-Cluster,Zhou12-P2S2}.

One approach for dealing with the uncertainty of processing time is to
build a robust schedule~\cite{cj09c,Gatto07,
  Davenport_slack-basedtechniques}, that is, building a schedule that
can naturally cope with variations in the processing times. These
techniques often use sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness
of the schedule. However, a better approach would be to be able to
dynamically change the schedule. 

The idea we are pursuing in this paper is to replicate the input data
of the tasks onto multiple machines. This way, when the actual
processing times of the tasks are too different from their
estimations, the system will have some room to adapt at runtime. This
is certainly feasible in practice as many system have more memory than
the computation use. For instance, most Hadoop system replicates the
data for the purpose of tolerating hardware
faults~\cite{White:2009:HDG:1717298}. And it has been shown that
launching the same task multiple times can help cope with hardware
differences~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/WangJW14} but increases resource
usage. The cost of replicating the data might be amortized in many
applications where the application will iterated over the data
multiple times ({\em e.g.}, in an iterative solver~\cite{Zhou12-P2S2,Zhou12-Cluster}). In this paper, we
answer the question ``can data replication help cope with the
uncertainty of processing time?''  And the answer is that it can.

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: we describe system
model and notations in Section~\ref{sec2}. Related works are presented
in Section~\ref{sec3}.  Section~\ref{sec4} investigates what can be
done if the tasks can only be deployed on a single machine, we
provide a guaranteed algorithm and provide a lower bound on the best
guarantee that one can achieve in this case. Section~\ref{sec5} takes
the reverse case and investigates what can be achieved if the data are
replicated everywhere, leaving the maximum flexibility at runtime. We
investigate one algorithm in this case and analyze its performance
guarantee. Section~\ref{sec6} investigates grouping processors
together and replicating data in these groups as an intermediate
between the previous two strategies and provide a guaranteed algorithm
in that case. Section~\ref{sec7} summarizes the various results we
derived and study the tradeoff between performance guarantee and data
replication.

\section{Problem Definition}\label{sec2}
Let $J$ be a set of $n$ jobs which need to be scheduled onto a set $M$
of $m$ machines. We will use interchangeably the terms machines and
processors. Also we will use interchangeably the terms jobs and
tasks. We are considering the problem where the scheduler does not
know the processing time $p_j$ of task $j$ exactly before the task
completes.  But the scheduler has access to some estimation of the
processing time $\tilde{p_j}$ of task $j$ before making any scheduling
decisions. We assume that the actual processing time $p_j$ of a task
$j$ is within a multiplicative factor $\alpha$ of the estimated
processing time $\tilde{p_j}$. $\alpha$ is a quantity known to the
scheduler. In other words the scheduler knows that:
 \begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\frac{\tilde{p}_{j}}{\alpha}\leq p_{j}\leq \alpha \tilde{p}_{j}
\end{equation}

Assuming that the processing time of the tasks is known to be in an
interval is reasonable in many application scenarios. One could derive
bounds experimentally using machine learning techniques: for
instance~\cite{You14-ICPP} used Support Vector Machines to predict the time it
will take to run graph traversal algorithms. Models of runtime of
algorithms can also be derived analytically:
in~\cite{Erlebacher14-ICS} the authors provide bounds for the
performance of various sparse linear algebra operations using only the
size of the matrices and vectors involved.


The scheduling for the problem is performed in two phases. Phase 1
chooses where data are replicated using the estimated processing time
$\tilde p_j $, for each of the task $j$. The phase takes
$\tilde{p_j}$, $m$ and $\alpha$ as inputs and outputs sets of machines,
$M_j \subseteq M $ where each task $j$ can be scheduled. This phase is
purely offline and corresponds to the operations performed to prepare
the execution of the application.

Phase 2 takes the output of phase 1 as its input and maps each task $j$
to a machine within the set of machines $M_j$. For each machine $i$,
let $E_i \subseteq J$ be the set of tasks assigned to machine
$i$. This phase chooses the actual schedule following an an online
semi-clairvoyant process. Only the approximate processing time is
known when a task is placed, but the scheduler can wait for a machine
to become idle, to place the next one. Therefore, can dynamically
schedule the tasks and the actual processing time of the tasks are
known once they complete.

The problem is to optimize the makespan, $C_{max} = \max_i \sum_{j \in
  E_i} p_j$ which is the completion time of the last task of the
system. $C_{max}^{*}$ denotes the optimal makespan of an instance of
the problem (knowing the actual processing times). An offline algorithm is
said to be a $\rho$-approximation algorithm (or to have an
approximation ratio of $\rho$) if it guarantees for all the instances
that $C_{max} \leq \rho C_{max}^*$. When the problem is online, we are
talking about competitive ratios.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec3}

When $\alpha = 1$, the problem is exactly the classical independent
tasks scheduling problem on identical machines, which is known to be
NP-Hard~\cite{GareyJohnson79}. We use Graham's List Scheduling
(LS)~\cite{Graham66} and Largest Processing Time (LPT)
algorithms~\cite{Graham69boundson} to derive approximation ratios in
different scenarios. The LS algorithm takes tasks one at a time and
assigns them to the processor having the least load at that time. LS is a
2-approximation algorithm and is widely used in online scheduling
problems. LPT sorts the tasks in a non-increasing order of processing time and
assigns them one at a time in this order to the processor with the
smallest current load. The LPT algorithm has a worst case approximation
ratio of $\frac{4}{3}-\frac{1}{3m}$ in the offline setting. One can
even obtain an arbitrarily good approximation algorithm for this problem by increasing
its complexity with a dual approximation
algorithm~\cite{Hoch87}.


Based on various models for describing the uncertain input parameter,
various methodologies can be used including reactive, stochastic,
fuzzy and robust approach~\cite{DBLP:journals/cce/LiI08}. We are using
the bounded uncertainty model which assumes that an input parameter
have value between a lower and upper bound.  Wierman and
Nuyens~\cite{conf/sigmetrics/WiermanN08} introduce SMART, a
classification to understand size-based policies and draw analytic
co-relation between response time and estimated job size in single
server problem. Robust approaches to deal with uncertainty are widely
used on MapReduce
systems~\cite{Kavulya:2010:ATP:1844765.1845224}~\cite{Verma:2011:AAR:1998582.1998637},
in
Hadoop~\cite{Wolf:2010:FSA:2023718.2023720}~\cite{White:2009:HDG:1717298},
on databases~\cite{Lipton199518} and on web
servers~\cite{Cardellini99dynamicload}. The HSFS and FLEX schedulers
provide robustness in scheduling against uncertain job
size~\cite{Wolf:2010:FSA:2023718.2023720,6691554}. Cannon and
Jeannot~\cite{cj09c} analyzed the correlation between various metrics
used to measure robustness and provided scheduling heuristics that
optimizes both makespan and robustness for scheduling task graph on
heterogeneous system.

Most of the work on robust scheduling use scenarios to structure
the variability of uncertain parameters. Daniels and
Kouvelis~\cite{citeulike:8334169} used them to optimize the flow-time
using a single machine. Davenport, Gefflot, and Bek analyzed slack
based technique (adding extra idle time) to cope with
uncertainty~\cite{Davenport_slack-basedtechniques}. Gatto and Widmayer
derives bounds on competitive ratio of Graham’s online algorithm in
scenario where processing times of jobs either increase or decrease
arbitrarily due to perturbations~\cite{Gatto07}.  These works
considered augmenting or decreasing of job processing times as
different problem scenario that need to be optimized. We 
approach the problem using worst case analysis where some tasks may
increase and some may decrease within the same schedule.
  
Data placement and replication methodologies are highly used in
distributed systems including peer-to-peer and Grid systems to achieve
effective data management and improve
performance~\cite{Cirne2007213}\cite{Abawajy}\cite{4215379}. Tse~\cite{DBLP:journals/tc/Tse12}
used selective replication of documents to increase the available
bandwidth to serve files using web servers and study the problem
through bi-criteria optimization techniques to maximize the quality of
service and minimize the memory occupation.

\section{Strategy 1: No Replication}\label{sec4}


This section considers the situation where the data of each task is
restricted to be on only one machine, {\em i.e.}, $\forall j, |M_j|=1$.  We
have a set $J$ of $ n$ jobs, and a set $M$ of $m$ machines.  Let $f :
J \mapsto M$ be a function that assigns each job to exactly one
machine. The restriction that the data of each task is deployed on a
single machine puts all the decision in phase 1: each task can only be
scheduled on one machine in phase 2.

\subsection{Lower Bound}


\begin{theorem}
\label{th:model1-lb}
  When $|M_j| = 1$, there is no online algorithm having competitive
  ratio better than $\frac{\alpha^{2}m }{\alpha^{2} + m-1}$.
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
  We use the adversary technique to prove the lower bound of this
  theorem. An adversary discloses the input instance piece by
  piece. It analyzes the choices made by the algorithm to change the
  part of the instance that has not been disclosed yet. That way it
  can build an instance that maximizes the competitive ratio of the
  algorithm.
 
  Let us consider an instance with $\lambda m$ tasks of equal
  estimated processing time $\forall j, \tilde{p_j} = 1$. After phase
  1, let $i$ be the most loaded processor which has $B$
  tasks. Obviously, $B \geq \lambda$. In phase 2 the adversary
  increases the processing time of the tasks on processor $i$ by a
  factor of $\alpha$ and changes the processing time of the other
  tasks by a factor of $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. So, $ C_{max}$ = $\alpha
  B$. ${C^{*}_{max}}$ will be no worse than any feasible solution. In
  particular, the solution that distributes equally the jobs of size
  $\alpha$ and the jobs of size $\frac{1}{\alpha}$. Therefore
  ${C^{*}_{max}} \leq \frac{1}{\alpha }\ceil {\frac{\lambda m - B
    }{m}}+ \alpha\ceil{\frac{B}{m}} $.  Figure~\ref{fig:rara} depicts
  the online solution and the offline optimal. We have,
 \begin{equation}\nonumber
   \frac{C_{max}}{C^{*}_{max}}
   \geq \frac{\alpha^{2} B  }{\ceil{\frac{
        \lambda m - B }{m}}+\alpha^2\ceil{\frac{B}{m}}}
 \end{equation}
   
 Since $\frac{ \lambda m - B }{m} +1 \geq\ceil{\frac{ \lambda m - B
   }{m}}$ and $\frac{B}{m}+1\geq\ceil{\frac{B}{m}}$, we have
 \begin{equation}\nonumber
   \frac{C_{max}}{C^{*}_{max}}
   \geq \frac{\alpha^{2} B  }{\frac{
       \lambda m - B }{m}+1+\alpha^2\frac{B}{m}+\alpha^{2}}
 \end{equation}
 
 From above expression it is clear that the smaller the value of $B$, the more the
 value of the expression decreases. So, any algorithm should minimize
 $B$ to achieve better performance.  For a schedule to be feasible the
 condition $B \geq \lambda$ must be satisfied. For $B = \lambda$ the
 value of $\frac{C_{max}}{C^{*}_{max}}$ is minimum and is equal to
 $\frac{\alpha^{2} m \lambda }{\lambda(\alpha^{2}+m-1)+
   m(\alpha^{2}+1)}$. The adversary can maximize the ratio of the
 algorithm by arbitrarily increasing $\lambda$. When $\lambda$ tends
 to $\infty$, we have
 \begin{equation}\nonumber
       \frac{C_{max}}{C^{*}_{max}}
       \geq \frac{\alpha^{2}m  }{\alpha^{2}+m-1}
     \end{equation}

    online solution, the adversary increases 
    the processing time of a task of the most loaded machine by a factor of $\alpha$. If
    that information was available beforehand, an optimal offline
    algorithm could have distributed these longer tasks to other
    processors.}
  \label{fig:rara}
  \end{figure}
\end{proof}    
  
  
  \begin{corollary}
  When $m$ goes to $\infty$ there is no online algorithm having competitive ratio better than $\alpha^{2}$.
  \end{corollary}
  
\subsection{Algorithm}

We present the algorithm \textbf{LPT-No Choice}. In phase~1, the
algorithm distributes the data of the tasks to the processor using
their estimated processing times according to 
LPT~\cite{Graham69boundson}: The tasks are sorted in non-increasing
order of their processing time and are greedily scheduled on the
processor that minimizes the sum of $\tilde{p_j}$ of the tasks
already allocated on that processor. Since there is no replication, there is
no decision to take in phase~2.

The performance of the algorithm depends mostly on how much the actual
processing times of the tasks differ from their estimation. It also depends on the
existence of a better arrangement if the actual processing times were
known. The following theorem states the theoretical guarantee of the
algorithm.

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:strat1-ub}
The \textbf{LPT-No Choice} has a competitive ratio of $ \frac{2\alpha^{2}m}{2\alpha^{2}+ m-1}$.
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof}
  The algorithm assigns the jobs to processors based on their
  estimated processing times using LPT in phase~1. So, the
  planned makespan considering the estimated processing times of tasks,
  $\tilde{C}_{max}$ have the following relation with the total
  estimated processing time, $\tilde{p_j}$ and estimated processing
  time of the task  $l$ that reaches $\tilde{C}_{max}$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
\tilde C_{max}\leq  \frac{\sum{\tilde p_j + (m-1) \tilde p_l} }{m}
\end{equation}

The actual makespan of a schedule, $C_{max}$, obtained using the
actual processing times of all the jobs, must be smaller than $C_{max} \leq \alpha
\tilde C_{max}$ (thanks to Equation~\ref{eq1}). We
have following inequality:
\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
  C_{max}\leq \alpha \tilde C_{max}\leq \alpha \left ( \frac{\sum{\tilde p_j + (m-1) \tilde p_l} }{m} \right )
\end{equation} 

The worst case situation is when the tasks of the processor where the
sum of estimated processing time is $\tilde C_{max}$ sees the actual
processing time of its tasks being $\alpha$ times larger than their
estimate; meanwhile the processing time of the tasks on the rest of the
processors is $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ times their estimation. The argument
behind this statement is that greater the value of ratio
$\frac{C_{max}}{\sum{p_j}}$, the worse the algorithm approximation
ratio will be. So the total actual processing time is
given by the following equation.
 \begin{equation}\label{eq4}
 \sum {p_j} = \frac{\sum \tilde{p_j}- \tilde{C_{max}}}{\alpha} + \alpha \tilde C_{max}
 \end{equation}
 
 Also the actual optimal makespan has the following constraint
 \begin{equation}\nonumber 
C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{\sum {p_j}}{m}
\end{equation}

Substituting for  $ \sum {p_j}$, we have
 \begin{equation}\nonumber 
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{\sum \tilde{p_j}- \tilde{C_{max}}}{\alpha} + \alpha \tilde C_{max}
 \end{equation} 
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{\sum \tilde{p_j} - \left( \frac{\sum{\tilde{p_j} + (m-1) \tilde{p_l} }}{m} \right )} {\alpha} + {C_{max}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{\alpha m} \left( \sum \tilde p_j - \tilde{p_l} \right) + {C_{max}}
 \end{equation}

 By the property of LPT, $\sum \tilde p_j-\tilde p_l \geq m (\tilde C_{max}-\tilde p_l)$, we have,
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
  m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{\alpha } \left( \tilde{C_{max}} - \tilde{ p_l} \right) + {C_{max}}
 \end{equation}
 
 All the instances where there is only one task per processor are always
 optimal. Therefore, we can restrict our analysis without loss of
 generality to instances with at least two jobs per processor. (Notice
 that in the original proof of Graham's LPT~\cite{Graham69boundson},
 an argument is made that all instances with two tasks per machine are
 optimal. However, the argument does not port in our case where only
 estimated processing times are known.) For at least two jobs on the
 processor that reaches $\tilde{C}_{max}$, the (estimated)
 processing time of last job is smaller than half the estimated
 makespan, $\tilde{p_l} \leq \frac{\tilde{C}_{max}}{2}$. Substituting
 this expression in the above equation, we have
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{\alpha } \left( \tilde C_{max}-\frac{\tilde C_{max}}{2} \right ) + {C_{max}}
\end{equation}

Using equation~\ref{eq3},
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{2\alpha } \frac{C_{max}} {\alpha} + {C_{max}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \left( \frac{m-1}{2\alpha^{2} } +1\right){C_{max}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}}\leq \frac{2\alpha^{2}m}{2\alpha^{2}+ m-1}
\end{equation}
\end{proof} 

\section{Strategy 2: replicate data everywhere}\label{sec5}

With this strategy, we put no restriction on phase 2. The tasks are
replicated everywhere i.e. $\forall j, |M_{j}|=|M|$. We introduce the
\textbf{LPT-No Restriction} which replicates the data of all the tasks
on each machine in the first phase. In the second phase we simply use
the Longest Processing Time algorithm (LPT) in an online fashion using
the estimated processing time of the task. That is to say, the tasks
are sorted in non-increasing order of their estimated processing
time. Then the task are greedily allocated on the first
processor that becomes available. Note that this is done in phase~2,
the processor become available when the actual processing time of
the task scheduled onto it elapses.

\begin{lemma}\label{No Restriction}
  Let $l$ be the task that reaches $C_{max}$ in the solution
  constructed by \textbf{LPT-No Restriction}. If there are at least two
  tasks on the machine that executes $l$ in \textbf{LPT-No Restriction}, then 
  $C_{max}^* \geq {\frac{2}{\alpha^{2}}} p_l$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since there are at least two tasks on the machine that executes $l$
  in \textbf{LPT-No Restriction}, there are at least $m+1$ tasks $j$
  such that $\tilde{p_j} \geq \tilde{p_l}$. Therefore in any solution
  at least one machine gets two tasks $c$ and $d$, such that $\tilde
  p_c \geq \tilde p_l$ and $\tilde p_d \geq \tilde p_l$. $C_{max}^{*}$
  must be greater than sum of the processing time of these two tasks.
   \begin{equation}\nonumber
    C_{max}^{*}\geq p_c + p_d
  \end{equation}	

  As the actual processing time of a task must be greater than
  $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ times of its estimated value, we have $p_c \geq
  \frac{1}{\alpha}\tilde{p_c}$ and $p_d \geq
  \frac{1}{\alpha}\tilde{p_d}$. Using this
  \begin{equation}\nonumber 
    C_{max}^{*} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha}\tilde p_c +  \frac{1}{\alpha} \tilde p_d \geq \frac{2}{\alpha}\tilde p_l
  \end{equation}
Since, $\tilde p_l \geq \frac{1}{\alpha} p_l$, we have
  \begin{equation}\nonumber
    C_{max}^{*} \geq {\frac{2}{\alpha^{2}}} p_l 
  \end{equation}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{th:strategy2}
  \textbf{LPT-No Restriction} has a competitive ratio of
  $\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq 1 + (\frac{m-1}{m})
  \frac{\alpha^{2}}{2}$
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof}
  The optimal makespan, $C_{max}^{*}$ must be at least equal to the
  average load on the $m$ machines. We have
  \begin{equation}\label{eq7}
    C_{max}^{*}\geq\frac{\sum p_j}{m}
  \end{equation}

  By the property of LPT (actually, it is a property of List
  Scheduling which LPT is a refinement of) the load on each machine
  $i$ is greater than the load on the machine which reaches $C_{max}$
  before the last task $l$ is scheduled. So for each machine $i$,
  $C_{max} \leq \sum_{j \in E_i}^{}{p_j} + p_l$ holds true.  Summing
  for all the machines we have
  \begin{equation}\nonumber
    mC_{max} \leq  \sum {p_j} + (m-1)p_l
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq8}
    C_{max} \leq  \frac{\sum {p_j}}{m} + \frac{(m-1)}{m}p_l
  \end{equation}
  
  Using Equations~\ref{eq7} and~\ref{eq8}, we have
  \begin{equation}\nonumber
    \frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq 1 + {\frac{m-1}{m}}\left(\frac{p_l}{C_{max}^{*}}\right)
  \end{equation}
  
  Using Lemma~\ref{No Restriction}, we have 
  \begin{equation}\nonumber
    \frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq 1 + \left(\frac{m-1}{m}\right)\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2}
  \end{equation}

\end{proof}  

Graham's List Scheduling algorithm always has a competitive ratio
of $2-\frac{1}{m}$. For $\alpha^2 < 2$, the \textbf{LPT-No
  Restriction} algorithm has better approximation than List
Scheduling. For $\alpha^2 > 2$ List Scheduling has better guarantee
than the one expressed in Theorem~\ref{th:strategy2}. Since
\textbf{LPT-No Restriction} is a variant of List Scheduling,
the algorithm has a competitive ratio of $\min (1 +
\frac{m-1}{2m}\alpha^{2}, 2-\frac{1}{m})$.



\section{Strategy 3: Replication in groups}\label{sec6}


This strategy partitions the processors into $k$ groups
$G1$,$G2$...$Gk$. The size of each group is equal and have
$\frac{m}{k}$ processors within each group. For the sake of
simplicity, we assume that we will only use values of $k$ such that
$k$ divides $m$. In the first phase, the data of each task is
replicated on all the processors of one of the $k$ groups,
{\em i.e.}, $\forall j, |M_j|= \frac{m}{k}$. In the second phase the tasks
are scheduled within the group they are assigned to in first phase.
Figure~\ref{fig:Model 3} shows the construction of the two phases.

We propose the \textbf{LS-Group} algorithm which is based on Graham's
List Scheduling algorithm. In phase 1, we use List Scheduling to
distribute the tasks to the $k$ groups of processors. In phase 2 each
task is scheduled to a particular processor within the group it was
allocated in phase 1 using the online List Scheduling algorithm.

\begin{figure*}[htp]

\begin{theorem}
  \label{th:strategy3}
  With $k$ groups, the competitive ratio of
  \textbf{LS-Group } is $ \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1} (1+
  {\frac{k-1}{m}} ) + \frac{m-k}{m}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
  We assume without loss of generality that $ C_{max}$ comes from
  group $G1$. $C_{max}^{*}$ must be greater than the average of the
  loads on the machines.
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{j \in J}^{}{{p_{j}}}}{m}
  \end{equation}

  $\sum_{j \in J }{{p_{j}}}$ can be written as sum of load on $G1$ and
  load on rest of groups.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq11}
    C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}+ \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{{p_{j}}}}{m}
  \end{equation}

  As in phase 1 tasks are allocated to different groups using List
  Scheduling with the estimated processing times of the tasks, the
  (estimated) load difference between any two groups cannot be greater
  than the estimated value of largest task ${max_{j \in J}}{\tilde
    p_{j}}$.  So, for any group $Gl \neq G1$, We have
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
\forall l \in \{2, 3, \dots ,k\}, \left |\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{j}}- \sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{j}} \right | \leq {max_{j \in J}}{\tilde p_{j}}
  \end{equation}  
  Adding for all values of $l$ leads to
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    \left | (k-1)\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{j}}- \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{j}} \right | \leq (k-1) {max_{j \in J}}{\tilde p_{j}}
  \end{equation}

  \textbf{Case 1:} If $(k-1)\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{j}} >
  \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{j}}$.
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{j}} \geq (k-1) \left( \sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{j}}- {max_{j \in J}}{\tilde p_{j}} \right)
  \end{equation}

  As the actual processing time of the tasks can vary within a factor
  $\alpha$ and $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ of their estimated processing time,
  the following inequality holds
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    \alpha\sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{{p_{j}}} \geq (k-1) \left( \frac{1}{\alpha}\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}- \alpha {max_{j \in J}}{{p_{j}}} \right)
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq9}
    \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{{p_{j}}} \geq (k-1) \left(\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}-  {max_{j \in J}}{{p_{j}}} \right)
  \end{equation}

  Phase 2 applies List Scheduling in the online mode. We assumed that
  $C_{max}$ comes from $G1$. Using the guarantees of List Scheduling
  we can write,
  \begin{equation}\label{eq10}
    C_{max} \leq \frac{\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}}{m/k} + {\frac{m/k-1}{m/k}} p_{max}
  \end{equation}
  where $p_{max}$ is actual processing time of longest task in $G1$.

  From Equation~\ref{eq9} and~\ref{eq11}, we derive
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}+ (k-1)\left(\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}-  {max_{j \in J}}{{p_{j}}}\right)}{m}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    \alpha^{2} (mC_{max}^{*} + (k-1){max_{j \in J}}{{p_{j}}}) \geq  (\alpha^{2} + k-1) \sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}  
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq12}
    \frac{\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}\left(m C_{max}^{*}+(k-1) {max_{j \in J}}{{p_{j}}}\right) \geq \sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{{p_{j}}}  
  \end{equation}
  
  Using \ref{eq10} and \ref{eq12}, We have
  \begin{align}{\nonumber}
    C_{max} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}\left( C_{max}^{*}+\frac{k-1}{m} {max_{j \in J}}{{p_{j}}}\right)\\
    + {\frac{m/k-1}{m/k}} p_{max} \nonumber
  \end{align}
  
  As $C_{max}^{*}\geq {{max_{j \in J}}{p_{j}}}\geq p_{max}$, we have
  \begin{align}{\nonumber}
    C_{max} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}\left( C_{max}^{*}+ {\frac{k-1}{m}}{C_{max}^{*}}\right)\\
    + {\frac{m-k}{m}} C_{max}^{*} \nonumber
  \end{align}    
  
  So, in Case 1 the algorithm has a competitive ratio of,
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    \frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}\left( 1+ {\frac{k-1}{m}} \right) + {\frac{m-k}{m}} \end{equation}\\
  
  \textbf{Case 2:} If $(k-1)\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{j}} \leq \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{j}}$. \\
  
  Since the processing times of the tasks can vary within a factor
  $\alpha$ and $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ of their estimated values, the
  expression for case 2 can be written as
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{j \in Gl }^{}{ p_{j}} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^2} (k-1)\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{ p_{j}}
  \end{equation}
  
  Putting this value in Equation~\ref{eq11}, we have
  \begin{equation}\label{eq13}
    C_{max}^{*} \geq \frac{\alpha^2+k-1}{m\alpha^2}\sum_{j \in G1 }^{}{ p_{j}}
  \end{equation}
  Using Equations~\ref{eq10} and~\ref{eq13}, and as $C_{max}^{*} \geq p_{max}$, we have
  \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
    C_{max} \leq \frac{k\alpha^2}{\alpha^2+k-1}C_{max}^{*}+\frac{m-k}{m}C_{max}^{*}
  \end{equation}
  
  So, in case 2 the algorithm has a competitive ratio of
  $\frac{k\alpha^2}{\alpha^2+k-1}+\frac{m-k}{m}$.

  Clearly, the algorithm has a worst competitive ratio in case 1.  So,
  the algorithm has a competitive approximation ratio of
  $\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}
  \left( 1+ {\frac{k-1}{m}} \right) + {\frac{m-k}{m}}$.
\end{proof}

% \begin{corollary}
%   When there are $2$  groups, the competitive ratio is $ 1+
%   \frac{2}{1+\alpha^{2}} (\alpha^2-\frac{1}{m})$.
% \end{corollary}

\textbf{LS-Group} uses List Scheduling in both its phases. A LPT-based
algorithm may have better guarantee. But without performing any
replication, {\em i.e.} when $k=m$, the \textbf{LS-Group} algorithm
has a competitive ratio almost equals to \textbf{LPT-No choice}'s when
the number of machines $m$ is large and the value of $\alpha$ is
within practical range. This indicates an LPT-based algorithm for
strategy 3 would likely not have a much more interesting guarantee.

\section{Summary}\label{sec7}
Table~\ref{tab:template} summarizes the results of this paper in term
of approximation theory. Based on adversary technique,
Theorem~\ref{th:model1-lb} states that there is no algorithm which can
give performance better than $\frac{\alpha^{2}m }{\alpha^{2} + m-1}$ for the model where no
replication is allowed. {\bf LPT-No Choice} is a
$\frac{2\alpha^{2}m}{2\alpha^{2}+ m-1}$-approximation that uses that
strategy. For the second strategy that replicates the data of all
tasks everywhere ( $|M_j| = |M|$), {\bf LPT-No Restriction} achieves a
competitive ratio of $1 + (\frac{m-1}{m})\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2}$.  The
third strategy uses replication within $k$ groups of size $m/k$ ({\em
  i.e.}, $|M_j| = m/k$). Using this strategy, the {\bf LS-Group}
algorithm has a competitive ratio of
$\frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}\left( 1+ {\frac{k-1}{m}} \right) +
{\frac{m-k}{m}}$.

Of course, there is an inherent tradeoff between replicating data and
obtaining good values for the makespan. To better understand the
tradeoff we show in Figure~\ref{fig:Graph} how the expressions of the
guarantees (or impossibility) translate to actual values in an
approximation ratio / replication space.  We picked 3 values of
$\alpha$ while keeping the number of machines fixed to $m=210$. 

When $\alpha=1.1$, even with multiple groups {\bf LS-Group} provides little
improvement over {\bf LPT-No Choice} in term of makespan guarantee. However there is a significant
gap between the guarantee of {\bf LPT-No Choice} and the lower bound
on possible approximation. When $\alpha$ is small, there is a
significant improvement in using {\bf LPT-No Restriction} over using
 {\bf LS-Group} with only 1 group.

When $\alpha$ increases to $1.5$, there is no more differences in the
guarantees of {\bf LS-Group} with 1 group and {\bf LPT-No
  Restriction}. Also {\bf LS-Group} provides many interesting intermediate
solutions between deploying the data on a single machine and deploying
them everywhere.

When $\alpha=2$, the range of the approximation ratios widens and
the value of the lower bound increases. Now {\bf LS-Group} is able to
get a better approximation using less than $50$ replications than 
can be guaranteed by deploying data on a single machine. Also, the
approximation ratio quickly improves from more than $7.5$ with the
data being replicated on $1$ machine to a ratio of less than $6$ with
only replicating the data on $3$ machines.

Overall, when $\alpha$ is large, only few replication improve the
performance significantly.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec8}

We studied the effect on uncertainty in the processing time of tasks
on scheduling for parallel and distributed machines. In particular, we
investigated how allowing tasks to execute on different machines can
help dealing with not knowing the processing time of tasks
accurately. We investigated three different replication strategies,
provided an approximation algorithm in each case and a lower bound on the
best achievable approximation in one of the case. The various
strategies allow to trade the number of replication for a better
guarantee. In particular, we obtained a better guarantee with fewer
replication than can be achieved by putting the data of a task on only
one machine. We observed that even a small amount of replications can
improve the guarantee significantly. Therefore, we concluded that
deploying the data on multiple machines can be an effective way of
dealing with processing time uncertainties.

There are some open problems which can be explored further. Better
lower bounds might help understanding the problem better: clearly when
$\alpha$ is low, the problem is no different than the offline problem,
and when it is large, the problem converges to the non-clairvoyant
online problem. Having a clearer idea of where the boundary is will
certainly prove useful in understanding how much can be gained using
data replication. Also, while replicating data using groups of
processors proved effective, more general replication policies can
certainly lead to better guarantees.

Though, we assumed that every tasks were replicated the same amount of
time. A more realistic model would introduce a cost of replicating a
task (either global or per machine). This would allow to replicate
only some critical tasks and limit memory usage.
