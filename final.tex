\section{Introduction}

Many real world scheduling problems related to task allocation in parallel machines are uncertain in nature. This fact makes the class of problem  known as 'scheduling with uncertainty' or 'robust' scheduling an important and most studied problem in Scheduling.  Often in  scheduling models the exact value of parameters such as processing times of tasks, are not known initially,   but they have a range outside which their values cannot  lie.  This paper draws qualitative analysis of the effect of replication in data placement for uncertain scheduling with inexact processing time of a task. Thus  our research brings two area of scheduling problem together i.e. task uncertainty and data placement.  The scheduling problem related to data placement and task allocation is common in heterogeneous systems and often dealt with common approach.  The objective of our reseach  is to propose an optimization approach that takes into account  effective data placement using replication to schedule  tasks in the environment where processing time of tasks are not known exactly but they can be estimated based on some pre estimated values.

Data placement technique can be useful in the scenario of uncertain processing times of tasks. Effective data placement using replication strategy allows better load balancing and hence reduces turnaround job time.   This paper is important in the sense that it proposes different models depending upon different scenarios and compares them based on approximation ratio and replication they allow.  Replication strategy that allows to place data in a wisely manner  offers a faster access to files required by  jobs, hence increases the job executionâ€™s performance. Replication helps in load balancing but it have certain cost attached with it as it usually increases resource usage\cite{IEEEhowto:wang}.  The paper deals with this problem and chooses the scenario in which replication is beneficial. 


There is very less literature available for scheduling with estimated processing time of a task.  Most of the literature till now focuses on job size estimation with small error.  Very less work is done which focuses on coping with less restrictive estimation for task size and which analyzes the effect of estimation on scheduling quantitatively.   Wierman and Nuyens \cite{IEEEhowto:Wierman} introduce $ \xi-SMART$ as classification to understand size based policies and draw analytical co-relation between response time and estimated job size in single server problem. \cite{IEEEhowto:Matteo} provides insight into scheduling behavior when estimation error is present and proposes FSPE+PS based policy to cope with this problem.
 
Size estimation based policies are widely used in practicality in the area of MapReduce and Hadoop. \cite{IEEEhowto:Wolf} \cite{IEEEhowto:Pastorelli} proposes schedulers which provides robustness in scheduling against uncertain Job Size. [NOTE: Have to include more references related web servers, database etc] 

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows:we describe system model and notatins in section 2. Sections 3-5 describes different problem models- 1)No replications, 2)replication is done everywhere and 3)replication is done within a group. The respective sections describe derivation of comptetitave ratios for each of these models. Section 6 summarises the 3 models and based on experimental results.  

\section{Problem Definition}
% no \IEEEPARstart
We have set $J$ of $n$ jobs which need to be scheduled to set $M$ of $m$ machines such that makespan, $C_{max}$ is minimized.   $C_{max}^{*}$ denotes optimal makespan of a schedule $S$.   We are considering the problems where the scheduler do not know the processing time of a task exactly before it completes, but we have some estimation of the processing time of a task before it is  assigned to a processor. We know that the actual processing time of a task $i$ is between $\frac{1}{\alpha}$and $\alpha$ times of its estimated processing time. $p_i$ denotes the actual processing time and $\tilde {p_i}$ denotes
estimated processing time for the task $i$.  We have this estimate:\\
\begin{equation} 
\frac{1}{\alpha}\leq \frac{p_{i}}{\tilde{p}_{i}}\leq \alpha
\end{equation}\\

[Note:give justification ]


We consider various problem models  incorporating the above mentioned scenario of uncertain processing times of tasks with an estimate. Depending upon  a problem model the scheduling is done in two phases or just in one phase. In Phase 1, we allocate tasks to certain processors or group of processors depending upon a problem model.  Phase 1 chooses where data to be  replicated using estimated processing time $\tilde p_i $, for each of the task $i$.  In Phase 2, we choose actual schedule with semi-clairvoyant algorithm which uses only approximate knowledge of initial processing time, and after scheduling the task the actual $p_i$ is known.  With  objective to find schedule which minimizes makespan, we investigate greedy algorithms for each of the problem models and prove their comptetitive ratios. \\

We have used  Graham's List Scheduling (LS) and Largest Processing Time (LPT) algorithms to derive approximation ratios in different scenarios. The LS algorithm takes tasks one at a time and assign  it to the processor having least load at that time. LS is 2-approximation algorithm and is widely used in online scheduling problems.  The LPT sorts tasks in decreasing order of processing time and assign them one at a time in this order to the processor with the smallest current load. The LPT algorithm have worst case performance ratio as $4/3-1/(3m) $ in offline setting
. Depending upon which among these two algorithms suits more for a problem model we have used these algorithms accordingly. 

\section{Model 1: No replication} 
In this problem model we have considered  situation where each task is restricted to be scheduled on only one machine.  We have a set $J$ of $ n$ jobs, and a set $M$ of $m$ machines. The processing time of job $j$ is $p_{j}$ on machine $i$. Let $f : J \leftarrow M$ be a function that assigns each job to exactly one machine. Let us denote $E_{i}$ as the set tasks which is assigned to a machine $i$.  The restriction that each task can be scheduled to only one machine restrict the problem constrution to phase one only. There is no replication of tasks in this model.\\
\\
We have  considered List scheduling and Longest processing time algorithms and have  assigned each task on machine on which they are restricted to.   Based on the estimated processing times of  tasks loaded on each machine we will derive makespan. \\

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
\subsection{Lower Bound}
\textbf{Lemma 1.1:}There is no online algorithm having competitive  ratio better than $\alpha^{2} $.\\
\textbf{Proof:}  We  use adversery technique to prove that there is no online algorithm having competitive  ratio better than $\alpha^{2} $\\
 
 Let total tasks be $\lambda M$ with $\tilde{p_i}=1$. After scheduling let the most loaded machine $j$ have $B$ tasks. So, $B \geq \lambda$. Adversery technique increases the task on $j$ by $\alpha$ and decreases the other task by $\alpha$. So, $ C_{max}$ becomes $\alpha B$ and ${C^{*}_{max}}\geq \frac{\alpha B + \frac{1}{\alpha }  (\lambda  M - B) }{M}$. We have,
 
 \begin{equation}\nonumber
\frac{C_{max}}{C^{*}_{max}}\leq \frac{\alpha^{2} B M }{\alpha^{2} B + \lambda M - B}=\frac{\alpha^{2}  M }{\alpha^{2}  + \frac{\lambda M}{B}  - 1}
 \end{equation} 
 So, the value of above expression is directly proportional to $B$. From above expression it is clear that smaller the value of $B$, the value of $\frac{C_{max}}{C^{*}_{max}}$ decreases.  For $B= \lambda$ the value of expression would be minimum and is equal to $\frac{\alpha^{2}  M }{\alpha^{2}  + \frac{\lambda M}{B}  - 1}$. So, any algorithm   cannot give competitive ratio better than this.
 
 
 
\subsection{Using LPT}

\textbf{Theorem 1.1:} Using LPT the competitive ratio is $ \frac{2\alpha^{2}m}{2\alpha^{2}+ m-1}$.

\textbf{Proof:} In this problem model we are assigning tasks to processors using LPT in offilne mode using non-inceasing order of estimated processing times of tasks.

 


 
\begin{equation}
\tilde C_{max}\leq  [\frac{\sum{\tilde p_j + (m-1) \tilde p_l} }{m}
\end{equation}

where $\tilde C_{max}$ is makespan considering esimated processing  times  of tasks.  Also actual processing time  $C_{max}$ must be smaller the $\alpha\tilde C_{max}$, we have \\

\begin{equation}
 C_{max}\leq \alpha \tilde C_{max}\leq \alpha [\frac{\sum{\tilde p_j + (m-1) \tilde p_l} }{m}] 
\end{equation} 

Considering worst case situation the $\tilde C_{max}$ will increase to $\alpha$ times and load on rest of the processors will shrink  $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ times. So total actual prosessing time will be given by following equation.  The argument behind this is that greater the value of ratio $\frac{C_{max}}{\sum{p_j}}$, the algorithm will give bad approximation. So increasing the load on machine wchich have $C_{max} $to maximum
value and decrasing rests of the load on other processors will reach worst case scenario. So total actual processing time will be given by following equation.
 \begin{equation}
 \sum {p_j} = \frac{\tilde p_j- \tilde C_{max}}{\alpha} + \alpha \tilde C_{max}
 \end{equation}
 
 Also the actual optimal processing time have following constraint
 \begin{equation}\nonumber 
C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{\sum {p_j}}{m}
\end{equation}

After putting the value of  $ \sum {p_j}$, we have

 \begin{equation}\nonumber 
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{\tilde p_j- \tilde C_{max}}{\alpha} + \alpha \tilde C_{max}
 \end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
\Rightarrow m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{\tilde p_j-[\frac{\sum{\tilde p_j + (m-1) \tilde p_l }}{m}]} {\alpha} + {C_{max}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\nonumber
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{\alpha m} [\sum \tilde p_j-\tilde p_l] + {C_{max}}
 \end{equation}

By the property of LPT $\sum \tilde p_j-\tilde p_l \geq m (\tilde C_{max}-\tilde p_l)$, putting this we have,\\
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
 m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{\alpha } [\tilde C_{max}-\tilde p_l] + {C_{max}}
 \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Rightarrow m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{\alpha } [\tilde C_{max}-\frac{\tilde C_{max}}{2}] + {C_{max}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Rightarrow m C_{max}^{*}\geq \frac{m-1}{2\alpha } [\frac{C_{max}} {\alpha} ]+ {C_{max}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Rightarrow m C_{max}^{*}\geq[\frac{m-1}{2\alpha^{2} } +1]{C_{max}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Rightarrow \frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}}\leq \frac{2\alpha^{2}m}{2\alpha^{2}+ m-1}
\end{equation}



\section{Model 2: replication is done everywhere}
In this problem model we consider no restrictaion on task assignment.  There is no initial first phase to select where replication need to be done.  All tasks are allowed to replicate everywhere There are $ n$ tasks which need to be  assigned to $m$ processors. We have applied simple Largest Processing Time Algorithms (LPT) using estimated processing times of tasks in non-increasing order as input.  \\




\textbf{Theorem 2.1:} $C_{max}^{*} \geq {\frac{2}{\alpha^{2}}} p_l $ for when there are at least two tasks in the machine to which $l$ is scheduled.

\textbf{Proof:} Suppose $l$ be the last task with estimated processing time $\tilde p_l$. Suppose
there are at least two tasks in the machine in which $l$ is assigned including $l$. Let
$C_{max}$ be the be makespan of the schedule and $C_{max}^{*}$ be the optimal makespan.\\

As there is at least one task $j$ before $l$ in the machine to which $l$ is
assigned, we have
\begin{equation}\nonumber
C_{max}^{*}\geq p_l + p_j
\end{equation}



As actual processing time of a task must be greater than $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ times of its estimated value, we have
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
C_{max}^{*} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha}\tilde p_l +  \frac{1}{\alpha} \tilde p_j 
\end{equation}
\\
As $j$ is scheduled before $l$ using LPT on estimated values of processing times,  $\tilde p_j\geq   \tilde p_l$ holds true for tasks $l$ and $j$.  Using this, we have\\

\begin{equation}\nonumber
 C_{max}^{*} \geq \frac{2}{\alpha}\tilde p_l
 \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
\Rightarrow C_{max}^{*} \geq {\frac{2}{\alpha^{2}}} p_l  \end{equation}

So, for at least two tasks in machine, We have the following condition\\
\begin{equation}
C_{max}^{*} \geq {\frac{2}{\alpha^{2}}} p_l 
\end{equation}
\\
\textbf{Theorem 2.2:} $\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq 1 + (\frac{m-1}{m})\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2}$\\
\\
\textbf{proof:} The optimal makespan, $C_{max}^{*}$ must be atleast equal to average load on the $m$ machines, We have\\
\begin{equation}
C_{max}^{*}\geq\frac{\sum p_j}{m}
\end{equation}

By the property of LPT the load on each machine $i$ is greater than the load on machine which reach $C_{max}$ before the last task $l$ is scheduled. So for each machine, $C_{max} \leq  \sum_{j \in E_i}^{}{p_j} + p_l$ holds true.  Adding for all the machines, We have\\

\begin{equation}\nonumber 
mC_{max} \leq  \sum {p_j} + (m-1)p_l
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{max} \leq  \frac{\sum {p_j}}{m} + \frac{(m-1)}{m}p_l
\end{equation}
\\
Using (6) and (7), We have\\

\begin{equation}\nonumber
\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq 1 + {\frac{m-1}{m}}(\frac{p_l}{C_{max}^{*}})
\end{equation}

As $C_{max}^{*} \geq {\frac{2}{\alpha^{2}}} p_l $, We have \\

\begin{equation}\nonumber
\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq 1 + (\frac{m-1}{m})\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2}
\end{equation}
Hence the theorem follows.   \\                            



\section{Model 3: Replication in groups}
We are tackling the  problem of restricted scheduling where tasks are scheduled to machines in two phases. The first phase is in offline mode and each task is pre-assigned to a particular  group of processors. In the second phase the tasks are scheduled  within the group they are assigned to in first phase.   We have a set $J$ of $ n$ jobs.  The size of each group is equal and have $m/2$ processors within each group.  We have considered task allocation in a group such that each task can be assigned to only one group.  In phase 2  each task is scheduled to a particular processor within the group it was allocated in phase 1.  We propose  List Sheduling algorithm in both the phases. In phase 1 using LS we pre-assign the tasks in different groups.  In phase 2 we use online LS to schedule tasks to processors within each group.

\subsection{When number of groups is 2}

\textbf{Theorem 3.1:} When number of groups is 2 the approximation ratio is $1 + \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{1+\alpha^{2}} $ \\
\\
\textbf{Proof:} 
 Let us consider two groups be $G1$ and $G2$ and after phase 1 the load on  each of two processors be $\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}$ and $\sum_{i \in G2 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}$ respectively. Without loss of generality, We can assume makespan, $C_{max}$ comes from $G1$.  As the consequense of List Scheduling load difference between two groups cannot exceed estimated longest task, ${max_{i \in T}}{\tilde p_{i}}$\\
\begin{equation}\nonumber
|\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}- \sum_{i \in G2 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}| \leq {max_{i \in T}}{\tilde p_{i}}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\nonumber 
\Rightarrow \sum_{i \in G2 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}} \geq \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}} - {max_{i \in T}}{\tilde p_{i}}\end{equation}
\\
As the actual processing time of a task is between $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ and $\alpha$ times of its estimated value, so we have the following inequality\\
\begin{equation}\nonumber 
\Rightarrow \alpha\sum_{i \in G2 }^{}{{p_{i}}} \geq  {\frac{1}{\alpha}} \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} - \alpha {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow \sum_{i \in G2 }^{}{{p_{i}}} \geq {\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}} \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} - {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}
\end{equation}




In phase 2, We  apply List Scheduling in online mode. As makespan, $C_{max}$ comes from $G1$. Using List Scheduling, We have

\begin{equation}
 C_{max} \leq \frac{\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m/2} + {\frac{m/2-1}{m/2}} p_{max} 
\end{equation}

where $p_{max}$ is the longest task in $G1$
\\

Also, $C_{max}^{*}$ must be greater than the average of the  loads on  machines, We have\\

\begin{equation}\nonumber 
C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{i \in T }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Leftrightarrow C_{max}^{*}\geq  \frac{\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m} + \frac{\sum_{i \in G2 }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m} \end{equation}

from (8), We derive\\
\begin{equation}\nonumber
C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m} + {\frac{1}{m\alpha^{2}}} \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} - {\frac{1}{m}}{max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}} 
\end{equation}

 
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Rightarrow m\alpha^{2}[C_{max}^{*}+ \frac{{max_{i \in T}}{p_{i}}}{m}] \geq  \alpha^{2} \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} + \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} = (1+\alpha^{2}) \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} \leq \frac{m\alpha^{2}}{1+ \alpha^{2}}[C_{max}^{*}+ \frac{{max_{i \in T}}{p_{i}}}{m}] 
\end{equation}
\\
Using (9)and (10),

 $C_{max} \leq \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{1+ \alpha^{2}}[C_{max}^{*}+ \frac{{max_{i \in T}}{p_{i}}}{m}]  + {\frac{m-1}{m/2}} p_{max} $ \\
\\
 As $C_{max}^{*}\geq {{max_{i \in T}}{p_{i}}}\geq p_{max}$, we have\\
 
 $C_{max} \leq \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{1+ \alpha^{2}}[C_{max}^{*}+ \frac{C_{max}^{*}}{m}] + {\frac{m/2-1}{m/2}} C_{max}^{*} $\\
 
 So we have approximation ratio,\\
 $\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{1+\alpha^{2}} + \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{m{(1+\alpha^{2})}}  + \frac{m-2}{m}$\\
 \\
$ \leq 1 + \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{1+\alpha^{2}} $\\
\\
\subsection{When number of groups is k}
\textbf{Theorem 3.2:} When the number of groups is $k$ the approximation ratio is $  \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}[1+ {\frac{k-1}{m}} ]+ {\frac{m-k}{m}}   $ \\
\\
\textbf{Proof:} 
  We have $k$ groups of $m/k$ machines. We have restriction that each task can be assigned to only one of these groups. In Phase 1, each task is assigned to different groups. In Phase 2, tasks are scheduled online within repective group.

Let us consider  that $ C_{max}$ comes from group  $G1$. Also, taking the property of List Scheduling that the load difference between any two groups cannot be greater than the largest task. So, for any group $Gl \neq G1$, We have\\

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
|\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}- \sum_{i \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}| \leq {max_{i \in T}}{\tilde p_{i}}\end{equation}  \hspace*{15pt}   for all, $l = 2,3,...,k$ \\

Adding for all values of $l$, We have \\

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
|(k-1)\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}- \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{i \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}| \leq (k-1) {max_{i \in T}}{\tilde p_{i}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
\Rightarrow \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{i \in Gl }^{}{\tilde p_{i}} \geq (k-1)[\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{\tilde p_{i}}- {max_{i \in T}}{\tilde p_{i}}]
\end{equation}



As the actual processing time of tasks  can vary within a factor $\alpha$ and $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ of their estimated processing time, the following inequality holds\\
\\
\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
 \alpha\sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{i \in Gl }^{}{{p_{i}}} \geq (k-1)[\frac{1}{\alpha}\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}- \alpha {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{i \in Gl }^{}{{p_{i}}} \geq (k-1)[\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}-  {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}]
\end{equation}

In phase 2, We are applying LS on online mode. We assume that $C_{max}$ comes from $G1$. Using LS property we can write,

\begin{equation}
 C_{max} \leq \frac{\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m/k} + {\frac{m/k-1}{m/k}} p_{max} 
\end{equation}
\\

Also, $C_{max}^{*}$ must be greater than the average of the  loads on  machines.\\

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{i \in T }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{\nonumber}\Rightarrow C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}+ \sum_{l=2}^{k}\sum_{i \in Gl }^{}{{p_{i}}}}{m}
\end{equation}




from (11), we derive\\

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
\Rightarrow C_{max}^{*} \geq  \frac{\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}+ (k-1)[\frac{1}{\alpha^{2}}\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}-  {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}]}{m}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
\Rightarrow m\alpha^{2}C_{max}^{*} + \alpha^{2} (k-1){max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}} \geq  \alpha^{2}\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}+ (k-1)\sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow\frac{\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}[m C_{max}^{*}+(k-1) {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}] \geq \sum_{i \in G1 }^{}{{p_{i}}}  
\end{equation}
\\
Using (12) and (13), We have

\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
C_{max} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}[ C_{max}^{*}+\frac{(k-1)}{m} {max_{i \in T}}{{p_{i}}}] + {\frac{m/k-1}{m/k}} p_{max} 
\end{equation}
 As $C_{max}^{*}\geq {{max_{i \in T}}{p_{i}}}\geq p_{max}$, we have\\
\begin{equation}{\nonumber}
 C_{max} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}[ C_{max}^{*}+ {\frac{k-1}{m}}{C_{max}^{*}}] + {\frac{m-k}{m}} C_{max}^{*} \end{equation} \\
 

 
 So we have approximation ratio,\\
 \begin{equation}{\nonumber}
\frac{C_{max}}{C_{max}^{*}} \leq \frac{k\alpha^{2}}{\alpha^{2}+k-1}[1+ {\frac{k-1}{m}} ]+ {\frac{m-k}{m}} \end{equation}
