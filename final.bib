    abstract = {{Schedulers confronted with significant processing time uncertainty often discover that a schedule which is optimal with respect to a deterministic or stochastic scheduling model yields quite poor performance when evaluated relative to the actual processing times. In these environments, the notion of schedule robustness, i.e., determining the schedule with the best worst-case performance compared to the corresponding optimal solution over all potential realizations of job processing times, is a more appropriate guide to schedule selection. In this paper, we formalize the robust scheduling concept for scheduling situations with uncertain or variable processing times. To illustrate the development of solution approaches for a robust scheduling problem, we consider a single-machine environment where the performance criterion of interest is the total flow time over all jobs. We define two measures of schedule robustness, formulate the robust scheduling problem, establish its complexity, describe properties of the optimal schedule, and present exact and heuristic solution procedures. Extensive computational results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution procedures.}},

abstract = "Large distributed systems challenge traditional schedulers, as it is often hard to determine a priori how long each task will take to complete on each resource, information that is input for such schedulers. Task replication has been applied in a variety of scenarios as a way to circumvent this problem. Task replication consists of dispatching multiple replicas of a task and using the result from the first replica to finish. Replication schedulers (i.e. schedulers that employ task replication) are able to achieve good performance even in the absence of information on tasks and resources. They are also of smaller complexity than traditional schedulers, making them better suitable for large distributed systems. On the other hand, replication schedulers waste cycles with the replicas that are not the first to finish. Moreover, this extra consumption of resources raises severe concerns about the system-wide performance of a distributed system with multiple, competing replication schedulers. This paper presents a comprehensive study of task replication, comparing replication schedulers against traditional information-based schedulers, and establishing their efficacy (the performance delivered to the application), efficiency (the amount of resources wasted), and emergent behavior (the system-wide behavior of a system with multiple replication schedulers). We also introduce a simple access control strategy that can be implemented locally by each resource and greatly improves overall performance of a system on which multiple replication schedulers compete for resources.
