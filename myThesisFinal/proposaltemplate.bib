  review = {nifty! ok what's interesting in my case - before i get into this -
	is that in both the perceptual & verbal case space functions as a
	metaphor for non-spatial relationships. so i'm like a level removed
	as it is?
	
	
	hmmMMmm, he takes an amodal perspective? but would that make sense
	in terms of my results? let's see!
	
	
	aha, neither strictly perceptual nor propositional - sounds like requirements
	that would jive with PSS
	
	
	getting into this discussion of prepositions gets things closer to
	my interests! however, the egocentric/allocentric distinction isn't
	of much use to me, since i'm dealing in artificial 2d space, and
	these guys spend a lot of time on it.
	
	
	this is definitely a place to grab some terms and general framework
	for my discussion. really good connection from my work to the cognitive
	literature, since my work is after all more concerned with spatial
	layout than object representation, as Tversky's is. this has not
	been something i've highlighted so far, but it certainly should be!
	makes me focus a little more specific. and the focus on form over
	content is after all appropriate for a sontagian brat like myself...
	but that's neither here nor there.
	
	
	visualization styles as spatial scene schemata
	
	
	"It must be noted, however, that position errors tend to become magnified
	as a result of stochastic geometric transformations."
	
	oh this is getting INTERESTING. this is some nice theoretical backing
	for all this vague stuff i've been yammering about, fitting-to-metaphor
	etc. this paper is a motherfucking FIND}

	rather than interpretation? reasoning vs. knowledge formation, though
	the latter of course is assumed to be a prerequisite for the former.
	
	
	another significant difference is that i'm dealing with spatial layout
	rather than object representation. remember that vis people aren't
	gonna take that distinction for granted tho.}
